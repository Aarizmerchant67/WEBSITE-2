            <h2><u>What are they?</u> </h2>
            <h3>Shahada</h3>
                <p>
                    The shahada are the words 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.'
                    This means that Muslims believe that Allah is the sole God and Muhammad(a prophet)is his messenger.
                </p>
            <h3>Salah</h3>
                <p>
                    This means praying 5 times a day: Dawn, just after midday, afternoon, sunset and nighttime.
                </p>
            <h3>Zakat</h3>
                <p>
                    Zakat is when Muslims give a certain amount of charity(2.5%)to the poor. Although, there is a minimum amount of
                    income you earn before having to start charity.
                </p>
            <h3>Sawn</h3>
                <p>
                    Another word for Sawn is fasting. Muslims are expected to fast during the month of Ramadan. Ramadan is once a year. This is to make Muslims understand how people in poverty do and to show gratitude to Allah.
                </p>
            <h3>Hajj</h3>
                <p>
                    Hajj is when Muslims walk around the House of Allah. The House of Allah is in Mecca and they are expected to do Hajj at least a lifetime. However, if you are poor or don't have enough money to afford the trip you are excused to Hajj.
